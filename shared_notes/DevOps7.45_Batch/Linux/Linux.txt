1 To see the use who is currently logged in
  whoami

2 To see all the users logged into the linux server
  who

3 To create directories
  mkdir dir1

4 To create multiple directories one within another
  mkdir -p d1/d2/d3/d4

5 To remove an empty directory
  rmdir dir_name

6 To remove a directory which has files and sub directories
  rm -r dir_name

7 To move from one dir to another
  cd dirname
  Note   . represents current directory
        .. represents parent directory
        ~ represents home direcotry of current user
        Eg: cd ~   will take control to home dir of current user

8 To create files
  touch file1

9 To create multiple files
  touch file1 file2 file3
  Note: touch creates emptyr files.It can also be used for
  updating the time stamp of files

10 To create files that can store some data
  cat > filename
  Enter some data in the file
  To come out of cat command (ctrl+d) This represents EOF

  a) cat create a new file if the file is already not present
  b) it will overwrite the content of the exisiting file if
    file is already present

11 To see the content of a file
  cat filename

12 To append data to an exisiting file
   cat >> filename
   enter some data
   ctrl+d

13 To remove a file
   rm filename


14 To find home dir of current user
   echo $HOME

============================================================================
15 To move from one dir to another
   cd dir_path
   Note: . represents current working dir
        .. represents parent directory
        cd .. will take us to parent directory
        cd . will let us remain on the same working directory
   To goto parent directory 
   cd  (or) cd ~

====================================================================
To see the list of all files in present working dir
  ls

To see long listing of files
  ls -l  (it shows all the meta data realted to the file)

To see the files (visible and hidden)
  ls -a

To see the size of the files in human readable format
  ls -lh

To see the inode numbers of the files
  ls -li

To see the files based on their time stamps
  ls -lt

To see the files after reversing the time stamps
   ie older files first
  ls -ltr

To see the files recursively present in a dir
   ls -lR

========================================================================

1 To copy files
  cp srcfile destfile

2 to copy directories
  cp -R srcdir destdir

If the destination file is not present cp will create a new file
If the destination file is present cp will overwrite the file

3 To rename or move files
  mv srcfile destfile
  mv works like cut paste

==================================================================

Linking of files
----------------------
Linking is of 2 types
1 Soft link
2 Hard Link

Soft link is similar to a shortcut in windows.This is created for easy access of the files present at some remote loaction.If the original file is delete the shortcut is of no use

ln -s file1 file2
file2 is created as a shotcut for file1

Hard link will work even if the original file is deleted
ln file1 file3
file3 become hardlink file for file1
ls -li will display the same inode number for
both file1 and file3 and the link count will be 2
even if we delete the original file still we can access the date
rm file1
cat file3

================================================================================
Text Processing Tools
--------------------------
1 less
  This is used to display the text in pagewise format
  less filename

2 head
  This will display the top 10 lines of a file
  head filename
  To display top 3 lines of a file
  head -3 filename

3 tail
  This will display the last 10 lines of a file
  tail filename
  To display the last 4 lines of a file
  tail -4 filename

4 wc 
  This is used to find the number of lines,words and characters   in a  file 
  wc filename
  To find only the no of lines
  wc -l filename
  To find only the number of words
  wc -w filename
  To find only the number of charactes
  wc -c filename

5 sort
  Used for sorting the content of a file.By default it performs    an alphabetical sort
  sort filename
  To perform a numeric sort
  sort -n filename
  To perfrom a reverse numeric sort
  sort -nr filename


6 grep(globally search for a regular expression and printit)
  This is used for searching for a sequence of characters in a file.grep will display all the lines where the given string is present
  To search for a word called intelliq
  grep intelliq filename
  To search for intelliq ignoring its case
  grep -i intelliq filename
  To search for a word intelliq and also display the line   numbers
  grep -n intelliq filename
  To search for all the lines where the word intelliq is not   present
  grep -v intelliq filename

7 cut(This is used to capture the data in column fashion)
  To pick 1st and 7th column from /etc/passwd file
  cut -d ":" -f 1,7 /etc/passwd


===========================================================================
Redirection 
============================
> is output redirection
2> is error redirection
&> is both redirection

===============================================================================
Piping
=============
Sending output of a command as input to some other command is
called piping
