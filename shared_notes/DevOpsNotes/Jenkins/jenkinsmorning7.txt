Distributed builds in jenkins
--------------------------------
We can make jenkins run its jobs on multiple linux machines serially or parallely in a distributed network.
Image a  scenarion where we want ot execute multiple jobs through jenkins..these jobs can be realed to 
dev activites or testing activites or deploymnet activites.when we run these many jobs through one linux server performace will degrade.We can handle these secenarios through master-slave concept of jenkins

Creating a slave machine
----------------------------
1 Go to any other linux machin(not Jenkins server)
2 Install the same version of java which is present on the jenkins server
  add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
  apt-get update
  apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

3 Dowload slave.jar from the jenkins server
  wget http://192.168.61.11:8080/jnlpJars/slave.jar

4 Create a workspace
  mkdir workspace
  chmod 777 workspace

5 Open the dashboard of jenkins

6 manage jenkins-->manage nodes-->click on new node-->give nodename and select permeant agent
