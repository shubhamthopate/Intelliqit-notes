Day 1
==============================================

Configuration Management
===========================
This is the process of handling activites of multiple
servers from one point of control

Advantages
==============
1 Provisioning of Servers
  Activites like installing s/w applications,deleting s/w,upgrading
configuring patches can be done very quickly 

2 Resource Saving
  The time taken to configure any number of servers become very less
and the number of people who are required for these server configurations
also becomes less

3 Usefull in Disaster Recovery
  To handle disaster recovery organizations maintain replica data centers
at different geographical locations.Creation of these replica data centers
can be done very easily

4 Handling snowflake servers
  After a point of time all servers present in a data center behave like
snowflakes ie they run on slightly different h/w and s/w configurations.
Configuration Management tools can pick up this info and store in simple
config files which can be used later to setup similar environments

5 Idempotent
  Configuration managment tools are used to bring the remote to a state
called as the "desired state".If the remote servers are already in the 
desired state configuration management tools will not reconfigure these
server

Important Configuration Management Tools
=============================================
1 Ansible
2 Chef 
3 Puppet






Ansible
=============
This is an open source configuration management tool created using python
The main machine where ansible is installed is called as "Controller"
and the remianing remote servers that we are configuring are called as 
"managed nodes/hosts"

From the controller to the managed nodes we should have passwordless
shh connectivity

Ansible is called as "agentless" ie we need not install any client 
s/w of ansible on the remote managed nodes.It uses "push" methodolgy
to push the configurations into the remote servers.

=========================================================================
Setup of Ansible
====================
1 Create 3 or 4 AWS ubuntu 18 instances
2 NAme the 1st one as controller and remaining 2 as server1 and server2
3 Establish Passwordless ssh from Controller to Server1 and Server2
  a) Connect to server1 using gitbash
  b) Setup password for the default user
     sudo passwd ubuntu
  c) Edit the ssh configuration file
     sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     Search for "PasswordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
  d) Restart ssh
     sudo service ssh restart
     Repeat the above steps from a to d on Server2 managed node
  e) Connect to Controller using git bash
  f) Generate the ssh keys
     ssh-keygen
  g) Copy the ssh keys
     ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private_ip_of_server1
     Repeat step g with ipaddress of Server2

4 Installing Ansible
  a) Update the apt repository
     sudo apt-get update
  b) Install software-properties-common
     sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
  c) Add the latest version of Ansible to apt repository
     sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  d) Update the apt repository
     sudo apt-get update
  e) Install ansible
     sudo apt-get install -y ansible

5 To check the verision of ansible
  ansible --version

Ansible stores all the remote servers info in a file called as inventory file
We should open this file and store the ipaddress of all the managed nodes here

sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
Here copy and paste the ipaddresses of the managed nodes

===========================================================================
Day 2
==============================================================================
Ansible performs remote configuration of servers in
3 different ways
1 Adhoc commands
2 Playbooks
3 Roles

Ansible uses prebuild Python modules for configuring remote
servers

Important modules in Ansible
===================================
1 command: This is used to execute linux commands on the remote managed
nodes.It is the default module of Ansible

2 shell: This is used to execute shell scripts on the remote managed nodes
  it can execute command related to redirection and piping

3 user: This is used to perform user administartion on the remote servers
like creating users,assigning home dirs deleting users etc

4 file: Used for creating files/directories on the managed nodes

5 copy: This used to copy files/directories to the managed node

6 fetch: Used to copy files/directories from managed nodes to controller

7 apt: Used to for s/w package management like isntalling,deleting,upgrading
  etc.It works on Ubuntu,Debain flvours of linux

8 yum: This is similar to apt but it works on Rehat linux,Centos,Fedora etc
  flavours of Linux

9 service: Used to start stop or restart services on the managed nodes

10 uri: Used to check if a remote url is reachable or not

11 git: Used for perfroming git version controlling on the managed nodes

12 get_url: Used for downloading files from remote servers into the managed nodes

13 stat: Used to capture detailed info about files/directories on the managed nodes

14 debug: Used to display the output in JSON file format

15 include: USed to call child playbooks from a parent playbook

16 replace: Used to replace specific portions of the text in a file

17 docker_container: Used for container management on the managed nodes

18 docker_image: Used to run command related to docker images

19  docker_login: Used to login into the docker registry

20 docker_swarm: Used to setup of docker swarm architecture

ansible all -m uri -a 'url=http://172.31.48.61:8080 status_code=200'

=================================================================================
Ansible Playbooks
========================
Adhoc commands become difficutl to handle when working on complex
configurations of s/w applications.
Each adhoc command can work only on one module and one set of
arguments.In such cases we can use Ansible playbooks which 
support greater reusability.
Playbooks are created using yaml and each playbook is a combination of
multiple plays.A play contains info about what module has to be 
executed.These plays are designed to work on a single host or a
group of hosts or all the hosts


=======================================================================

XML and YAML files for storing data
====================================
<intelliqit>

Day 5
==========================================================================

Ansible playbook to copy file from one manged node to another managed node
---
- name: Fetch file from server1
  hosts: 172.31.55.129
  tasks:
   - name: Fetch the file
     fetch:
      src: myfile
      dest: /tmp
- name: Copy file to server2
  hosts: 172.31.48.61
  tasks:
   - name: Copy file
     copy:
      src: /tmp/172.31.55.129/myfile
      dest: /home/ubuntu
...


==============================================================================
Variables
=================
These are used for acheving greater reusability of the playbooks
They are catogired into 3 types
1 Global Scope Variables
2 PlayScope Variables
3 Host Scope variables

Global Scope variables are passed from the command prompt
using "--extra-vars" and they have the highest level of
priority

Host scope varibales are again classified into 2 type
a) Varibales to work on a group of hosts
b) Variables to work on a single host
Host scope variables have the second level of priority after global scope
varibales

Playscope variables are defined within the playbooks and they have the least
level of priority

==============================================================================
Ansible playbook for installing/uninstalling s/w applications
using global scope varibales

vim playbook5.yml
---
- name: Install s/w applications using variables
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install/uninstall s/w app
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...

The above playbook can be used with different sets of data
ansible-playbook playbook5.yml  --extra-vars "a=git b=present c=yes" -b
ansible-playbook playbook5.yml  --extra-vars "a=tree b=absent c=no" -b
ansible-playbook playbook5.yml  --extra-vars "a=tomcat b=present c=no" -b

==============================================================================
Ansible playbook to create users and create files and dirs
---
- name: Create users and create files/dirs in users home dir
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Create users
     user:
      name: "{{a}}"
      password: "{{b}}"
      home: "{{c}}"
   - name: Create files/dirs in users home dir
     file:
      name: "{{d}}"
      state: "{{e}}"
...

To execute the playbook with different sets of data
ansible-playbook playbook7.yml --extra-vars "a=Anu b=intelliqit c=/home/Anu                                               d=/home/Anu/dir1 e=directory" -b

ansible-playbook playbook7.yml --extra-vars "a=Ramesh b=intelliqit c=/home/Ramesh                                                d=/home/Ramesh/file1 e=touch" -b

=============================================================================


PlayScope varibales
=======================
These variables are defined within a play and they can
work only on that play

vim playbook8.yml
---
- name: Install s/w applications
  hosts: all
  vars:
   - a: tomcat9
   - b: present
   - c: yes
  tasks:
   - name: Install s/w
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...

The above playbook works like a template whose default behaviour is to
install tomcat9 but we can bypass that behaviour and make it work on
some other sets of data by passsing global scope variables using 
--extra-vars

ansible-playbook playbook8.yml  --extra-vars "a=apache2 b=absent" -b

==============================================================================
Day 6
==============================================================================
Grouping in inventory file
================================
sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts

172.31.48.61
[apserver]
172.31.50.184
[dbserver]
172.31.59.180
172.31.50.184
[servers:children]
webserver
apserver


==========================================================================
Host Scope Variables
-----------------------
These variables are further classified into 2 types
1) Variables to work on a group of hosts
2) Variables to work on a single host

Variables to work on a group of hosts
=========================================
These variables are create in a directory "group_vars"
This directory is created in the same folder where the playbooks
are present.In the group_vars directory we create a file whose
name is same as group name from the inventory file

1 Go to the folder where the playbooks are present
  cd path_of_playbooks_folder

2 Create a directory group_vars and move into it
  mkdir group_vars
  cd group_vars

3 Create a file whose name is same as a group name from the inventory file
  vim webserver
  ---
  a: firewalld
  b: present
  c: no
  ...

4 Go back to the folder where the playbooks are present
  cd ..
  
5 Create a playbook for using the above variables
vim playbook8.yml
---
- name: Install firewall  using host scope variables
  hosts: webserver
  tasks:
   - name: Install firewall
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...
      

6 To execute the playbook
  ansible-playbook playbook8.yml -b





==========================================================================
Variables to work on a single host
--------------------------------------
These variables should be created in a file whose name is same as ip
address of a remote managed node and this file should be created in
a folder called "host_vars" and this folder should be created in the folder
where all our playbooks are present

1 Go to the folder where the playbooks are present
  cd path_of_playbooks_folder

2 Create a directory host_vars and move into it
  mkdir host_vars
  cd host_vars

3 Create a file whose name is same as a ipaddress of a managed node
  from the inventory file
  vim 172.31.56.218
  ---
  a: Radha
  b: intellqiit
  c: 1243
  d: /home/Radha
  e: /bin/bash
  ...

4 Go back to the folder where the playbooks are present
  cd ..

5 Create a playbook to use the above varibles
vim playbook9.yml
---
- name: create user using host scope varibles
  hosts: 172.31.56.218
  tasks:
   - name: create user
     user:
      name: "{{a}}"
      password: "{{b}}"
      uid: "{{c}}"
      home: "{{d}}"
      shell: "{{e}}"
...

====================================================================
Tags are like alias to modules in ansible playbooks
Using tags we can get a bettwr control on the flow of
the playbook execution

vim playbook14.yml
---
- name: Tagging in Ansible
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install tree
     apt:
      name: tree
      state: present
     tags: tree_installation
   - name: Create user
     user:
      name: Anu
      password: intelliqit
     tags: user_creation
   - name: Copy /etc/passwd file
     copy:
      src: /etc/passwd
      dest: /tmp
...

To execute only the tagged modules
ansible-playbook playbook14.yml --tags=tagged -b

To execute only the untagged modules
ansible-playbook playbook14.yml --tags=untagged -b

To execute modules with a specific tag name
ansible-playbook playbook14.yml --tags=user_creation -b

Handlers
===================
1 Handlers are modules that are executed if some other module is executed
succesfully and it has made some changes.

2 Handlers are only executed after all the modules in the tasks section are executed

3 Handlers are executed in the order that they are mentioned in the handlers section and not in the order that they are called in the tasks section

4 Even if a handler is called multiple times in the tasks section it will
be executed only once

Error Handling(Exception Handling)
========================================
If a module fails ansible stops the execution of the playbook
If we know that a certain module might fail and still we want
the execution of the playbook to continue we can use Error handling
The section of code that might generate an error shoudl be given
in the "block" section if it fails the control will come to the 
"rescue" section,"always" section is executed everytime irrespective
of whether the block section passes or fails

---

Ansible Vault
=====================
This is a feature of ansible which allows us to protect the playbooks
via a password.Playbooks created using vault can be viewed,edited or
executed only if we know the password

1 To create a vault playbook
  ansible-vault create playbook_name.yml

2 To view the content of  a vault playbook
  ansible-vault view playbook_name.yml

3 To edit the content of  a vault playbook
  ansible-vault edit playbook_name.yml

4 To convert an ordinary playbook into a vault playbook
  ansible-vault encrypt playbook_name.yml

5 To convert a vault playbook into an ordinary playbook
  ansible-vault decrypt playbook_name.yml

6 To reset the password of a vault  playbook
  ansible-vault rekey playbook_name.yml

Roles in Ansibles
========================
Roles provide greater reusability then playbooks
Generally roles are used to configure s/w applications
Everything necessary to configure a s/w applications should be
present with the folder structure of a role
This aids in easy understanding and maintainance of CM activites

Roles should be create in /etc/ansible/roles folder

To create roles in some other locations
sudo vim /etc/ansible/ansible.config
Search for roles_path and give the path of the directory where
we want to create the role and uncomment it

Folder structrue of roles
================================
README.MD : This is a simple text file that is used to store info about
the role in plain English

defaults: This stores info about the application that we are configuring
and it also stores varibales of lesser priority

files: All the static files that are required for configuring a s/w application
are stored here

meta: Data about the data is called as metadata and this is used to store info about 
the roles like when it was created who created it what versions it supports etc
 
handlers: handlers are modules that are executed when some other module is 
successfull and it has  made some changes,all such handlers are stored in
this folder

tasks: The actual configuration management activity that has to be perfromed on the
remote servers is stored in this folder

templates: This is used to store dynamic configuration files

tests: All the modules that are used to check if the remote configurations
are successfull or not are stored in this folder

vars: This is used to store all the variables that are required for configuring
a specific s/w application.These variables have higher priority than the
variables in defaults folder.



Apache Role
========================
1 Go into the /etc/ansible/roles folder
  cd /etc/ansible/roles

2 Create a new role for apache2
  ansible-galaxy init apache2 --offline

3 check the tree structure of the role that we created
  tree apache2
