Linking of files
----------------------
Linking is of 2 types
1 Soft link
2 Hard Link

Soft link is similar to a shortcut in windows.This is created for easy access of the files present at some remote loaction.If the original file is delete the shortcut is of no use

ln -s file1 file2
file2 is created as a shotcut for file1

Hard link will work even if the original file is deleted
ln file1 file3
file3 become hardlink file for file1
ls -li will display the same inode number for
both file1 and file3 and the link count will be 2
even if we delete the original file still we can access the date
rm file1
cat file3
