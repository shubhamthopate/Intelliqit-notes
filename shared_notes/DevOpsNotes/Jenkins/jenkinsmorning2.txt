CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
===================================
Step 1
   Whenever the developer makes changes to his code he will upload those changes into Git hub.
Jenkins should detect that modifications have been done to the code and it should downlaod the code
This can be called continuous download.

Step 2
   The code that jenkins has downloaded should be converted into a war,ear or exe file using build tools like ANT,MAVEN,MSBuild etc.This can be called continuous build.

Step 3
   The war/ear file created in the previous step
should be deployed into application servers(tomcat,jboss etc) in QA environment.This is called continuous deployment

Step 4
   The testing team might have created some automation testing program(selenium).Jenkins should fire those programs and check if the applications is working correctly or not.This is continuous testing

Step 5
  Once the testing is passed Jekins should deploy the applciation into the Production environment
where the client can start accessing it.This is called continuous delivary.

The above 5 step when automated are called as CI/CD






Step 1 (Continuous Download)
-------------------------------
The developers uplaod their code into Git hub and 
give the url of the Git hub.we download that code through jenkins
1 Open the dashboard of jenkins(localhost:8080)
2 Click on new item
3 Enter item name as "Development"
4 Click on Free style project-->OK
5 goto the dsahboard of jenkins
6 Click on Manage Jenkins-->Manage Plugins
7 Click on Available section
8 Search for "git hub" plugin-->Install it
9 Go to the dashboard of jenkins
10 Go to the development job we created
11 click on doward facing arrow-->Configure
12 Go to Source code management-->Click on Git
13 enter the github url provided by developers
   https://github.com/selenium-saikrishna/maven.git
14 click on Apply-->Save
Note:Git should be installed on our machine
and the path of git.exe should be specified in jenkins
   Open c-->program files-->git-->bin-->copy the path of git.exe
Go to dashboard of jenkins
Click on Manage jenkins-->Global tools configurations
go to git location-->Give it some name and paste the
path of Git.exe-->Apply-->Save


Step 2 (Continuous Build)
---------------------------
1 Open the dashboard of jenkins
2 Go to the Development job we created
3 Click on downward arrow-->Configure
4 Go to Build section-->Add Build step
5 Click on Invoke top level maven targets
6 enter the targets as   (clean pacakage)
7 Click on apply-->Save


Step 3 (Continuous Deployment)
---------------------------------
1 Open the dashboard of jenkins
2 Click on Manage Jenkins-->Manage Plugins
3 Go to Available tab-->Search for "Deploy to   container" plugin
4 Install it
5 Go the dashboard of jenkins
6 Go to the development job we created-->Click on
  configure
7 Go to post build actions-->Click on Add post build   action-->click on deploy war/ear to container
8 Enter tomcat credentilas-->apply-->save

Configuring tomcat
====================
1 Download tomcat 7 from 
  https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
2 Extract it and open it-->open the conf folder
  open server.xml file-->Search for "connector port"
  and change the port no from 8080 to 8899
  Open tomcat-users.xml
  add the below statement
  <user username="admin" password="admin"                            roles="manager-script"/>
3 Open the bin folder in tomcat
4 click on startup.bat file

We should be able to access the home page of tomcat
from any browser(localhost:8899)
